# shinyappsCompiled

<!-- badges: start -->
<!-- badges: end -->

The goal of shinyappsCompiled is to deploy Golem application that contains C++ code to shinyapps.io
By default this is not possible because compilation of C++ can't be done when the application is launched.

Instead, the package must be isntalled and compiled during the deployment process. This is achevied by pushing the code to Github (private or public) and then installing the application using `devtools::install_github()`.

## Installation

You can install the development version of shinyappsCompiled from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` r
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("JMPivette/shinyappsCompiled")
```
